# Testing - a keyword driven framework library for automation functional testing of web application using selenium and java 

Step 1: Create a keyword-driven framework library for automation functional testing of web applications using Selenium and Java.

Step 2: Define a set of keywords that will be used to drive the automation testing process. These keywords should be specific to the web application being tested and should include actions such as navigating to a specific page, entering text into a form field, clicking a button, etc. 

navigate_to_page
click_button
enter_text
select_dropdown
submit_form
verify_text
verify_element_present
hover_over_element
switch_to_frame
switch_to_window
take_screenshot
scroll_to_element
wait_for_element
assert_url
assert_title
clear_field
drag_and_drop
right_click
double_click
execute_javascript.

Step 3: Create a spreadsheet that maps each keyword to a specific function in the Selenium and Java code. This will serve as a reference for the test automation team when creating test scripts.

Step 4: Create a class in Java that will be used to execute the keywords. This class should include methods that correspond to each keyword, and should utilize the Selenium library to perform the actions specified by the keyword.

Step 5: Create test scripts using the keywords defined in the spreadsheet. These scripts should utilize the methods in the Java class to perform the actions specified by the keywords.

Step 6: Execute the test scripts and record the results. Any issues or errors should be reported and addressed.

Step 7: Continuously update and maintain the keyword-driven framework library as needed, based on changes to the web application or new requirements for the automation testing process.
